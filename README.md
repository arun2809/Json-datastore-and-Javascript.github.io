Imagine you are creating a JSON data store for a Ecommerce platform like flipkart.com
or amazon.in
Create a JSON to show what fields you will choose and what type of data
(string/object/array) would you want to store in those field. Also, create a javascript file
containing following functions -
1) Function to Read data from JSON file and display it in console.
2) Function to find a particular entry from JSON store using a name or id (whatever
field you want)
3) Function to find a particular entry by its position/index (index in the array)
You are free to use any library if you want. You are allowed to create multiple JSON
files as well if you want.
